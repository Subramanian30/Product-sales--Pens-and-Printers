# Product-sales--Pens-and-Printers

Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large
organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk
chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other
companies.
We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them
with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing,
our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need
to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best
approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what
doesn’t.
The sales rep has pulled some data from their sales tracking system for us. They haven’t
included numbers for how much time was spent on each customer, but there may be some
other useful customer information in here.
The data only relates to the new products sold. As there are multiple different products, the
revenue will vary depending on which products were sold.
